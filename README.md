<h1> Tip-Calculator </h1>
<p> This is a basic mobile application which calculates the tip required in form of percentage and also has an additional functionality for splitting the amount in between number of people.</p><br>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<p>Reset and Calculate buttons have been provided and apart from that, the Delete button is also provided to correct errors while user inputs value. The Reset button resets the application to its default state. There are two ways in which a user can input the value in the amount text field, either using the decimal point provided in the custom keyboard or just entering the values similar to entering amount in a debit machine. I have taken the idea of a basic calculator to design the tip calculator application, where the user manually enters the decimal point, which in turn gives flexibility to the user.</p><br>
